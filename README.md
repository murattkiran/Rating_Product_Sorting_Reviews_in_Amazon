**Business Problem**

One of the primary challenges in e-commerce is accurately calculating the ratings given to products after sales. Resolving this issue has multiple benefits, including improving customer satisfaction on the e-commerce platform, enhancing product visibility for sellers, and ensuring a smooth shopping experience for buyers. Another issue involves properly sorting the product comments. The prominence of misleading comments can directly impact product sales, resulting in both financial losses and customer attrition. By addressing these two fundamental problems, both the e-commerce site and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can enjoy a seamless purchasing journey.
